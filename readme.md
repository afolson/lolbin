It's Yet Another Pastebin that does SUPER AWESOME THINGS like:

- Allow you to use cURL to create pastes (WOW!)
- Allow you to view pastes (HOLY STEAKNUGGETS!)
- Allow you to delete pastes (SWEET MOTHER OF CRAP!)
- Use UUIDs so HACKERS can't guess your pastes (because security through obscurity is best security!)

I'm not sure what you expected, but if it wasn't sarcasm I don't even know you right now.

## Install This

You know what to do (but in case you don't):

- Check this thing out from over yonder -->
- `composer selfupdate` because you know you haven't in a while
- `composer install`
- `npm install`
- Create your .env file
- `php artisan migrate`
- `php -S 127.0.0.1:9090 -t public/`
