# Lolbin

It's Yet Another Pastebin that does SUPER AWESOME THINGS like:

- Allow you to use cURL to create pastes (WOW!)
- Allow you to view pastes (Holy Crap!)
- Allow you to delete pastes (SWEET MOTHER OF CRAP!)
- Use UUIDs so HACKERS can't guess your pastes (because security through obscurity is best security!)

I'm not sure what you expected, but if it wasn't sarcasm I don't even know you right now.
